This blog serves to document different software development projects I'm working on, both for my benefit and for the benefit of the techie public. 

The idea is to post tutorials, describe bugs and their fixes and anything else that I figure might be useful. I should've gotten around to doing this long ago, as I myself have repeated old mistakes and should like to avoid that in the future. But they say better late than never, so here goes.

About me, I'm currently a Master of Computer Science candidate at Columbia University, on the Machine Learning track. I received my Bachelor's in 2014 from the Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro where I majored in Information Systems. Sometime in September of 2010, I wrote my first 'Hello world' in C and I can still remember feeling insanely proud of that trivial accomplishment. It was (is) a steep learning curve and I'm hoping this blog will be especially useful for developers in the making. I have a penchant for all things data mining, I've recently worked on a wicked project for Google Summer of Code 2014 with WebRTC.
